# Roadmap

Single source of truth for improvement ideas. Merged from the old `AlexNotes.md`, the
root `Update the auto complete address to focu.md`, and the prior ideation backlog.

## How to execute

Pick any item under **Ready** and tell Claude `do <item>`. It runs the standard loop —
`ce-brainstorm` → `writing-plans` → `subagent-driven-development` — exactly like the PDF
work, and ships per [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md). Items under **Needs brainstorm** are
bigger; they get their own brainstorm to define scope before planning.

**Moving an item to ✅ Shipped is the last step** — do it only after the work is built,
verified, and deployed, never before. See [ONBOARDING.md](ONBOARDING.md#how-we-work).

Each item: title — one-line mechanic — **(size S/M/L)** — grounding (files/helpers to reuse).

---

## ✅ Shipped

- **Catalog-linked work-type templates** — work-type template line items now reference the
  Parts & Labor catalog by id (pure reference; name/price resolve live from one place).
  Legacy free-form rows still work. Add products to a work type via the catalog picker or a
  new inline "New item" (auto-saved to the catalog); assign one product to many work types
  from a new product edit sheet (which also renames/reprices). Deleting a referenced product
  is blocked with the work-type list. Selecting a work type on a new WO snapshots resolved
  prices, so historical bills stay frozen. Also: **clone work type**. No migration —
  additive; row shape is `{catalogItemId, qty}` or legacy `{description, qty, unitPrice}`.
  (`templateItems.js`, `db.js`, `WorkTypeManager.jsx`, `CatalogManager.jsx`, `WorkOrderNew.jsx`)
- **Admin-editable picklists** — payment methods, phone labels, and account terms are
  admin-managed from Settings → Lists & templates via a generic `lists` table (`db.version(6)`)
  + a shared `ListManager` editor and `ListPicker`. Records store values by name (no
  migration; deleting a value never orphans data). The Do-not-service warning moved to a
  dedicated account `doNotService` flag (legacy `terms === 'Do-not-service'` still honored).
  Stages intentionally kept in their own table. (`db.js`, `ListManager.jsx`, `ListPicker.jsx`)
- **Settings reorganized into collapsible groups** — everyday items stay visible (Display &
  accessibility, Reports, Backup); setup/admin items tuck into collapsible groups (Business
  profile, Lists & templates, Job workflow, Integrations, Advanced), each remembering its
  open/closed state per device. (`Settings.jsx`, `styles.css`)
- **Configurable WO stage pipeline** — admin-defined stages (Open → Scheduled → In progress
  → Completed → Invoiced → Paid) replace the binary open/completed toggle; each WO carries
  `stageId` + `stageHistory`, the Dashboard flags "stuck > N days." No migration —
  additive `db.version(5)` `stages` table; legacy records map lazily via `resolveStage` and
  every change keeps the legacy `status`/`completedAt` shadow. Feature-flagged (default on).
  The stage selector sits at the top of the work-order detail and New Work Order screens.
  (`stages.js`, `StageManager.jsx`, `db.js`)
- **Partial payments + balance due** — `payments[]` per bill (amount + method + date +
  reference); paid/partial/unpaid derive from the running balance; PDF lists payments with a
  PAID IN FULL / Balance due trailer. Legacy single-payment bills synthesize on read (no
  migration); mutators are transactional. (`payments.js`, `db.js`, `WorkOrderDetail.jsx`,
  `pdf.js`)
- **Account rating (1–5★) + terms/flags** — `rating` + terms picklist
  (COD / Net-30 / Prepay / Do-not-service); 1★ or Do-not-service shows a warning banner when
  starting a new WO. Schemaless (no migration). (`AccountForm.jsx`, `AccountDetail.jsx`,
  `WorkOrderNew.jsx`, `accountWarning` in `unpaid.js`)
- **Per-account outstanding rollup** — Account detail shows total balance owed + last-paid
  date (`accountOutstanding` in `unpaid.js`); sums bill *balance* so partial payments reflect.
- **Work-type icon picker (admin)** — the work-type editor sets the `icon` field via a chip
  grid of the existing icon set. (`WorkTypeManager.jsx`, `iconNames` export in `Icon.jsx`)
- **Tap-to-everything** — phone `tel:`/`sms:` (Text button), email `mailto:`, and a one-tap
  **Navigate** link for addresses across WO / Account / Contact detail. (`PhoneRow.jsx`,
  `NavigateLink.jsx`, `mapsHref`/`smsHref`)
- **PDF photo compression** — job photos downscaled (1600px / q0.72 JPEG) at
  PDF-generation time so the Bill of Sale stays under the ~24 MB email limit; IndexedDB
  originals untouched. (`image.js`)
- **Bill of Sale header overlap fix** — even spacing in the title/meta band. (`pdf.js`)

## ✅ Already exists — do not rebuild

Verified in code. Listed so they aren't re-proposed.

- **Date filters on the WO list** — `DATE_CHIPS` (Any/Today/7d/30d/Month/Quarter) in `Work.jsx`.
- **Search WO by bill #** — SearchBar feeds `filterWorkOrders` (`workFilter.js`).
- **Quarterly / YTD sales-tax summary** — in `Reports.jsx` (`salesTax.js`).
- **"Who owes me money"** — unpaid shortlist on the Home dashboard (`unpaid.js`).
- **Accessibility (dark mode + high-contrast + font scaling)** — Settings already has
  Appearance (System / Light / Dark) and Accessibility (High contrast, Text size
  Normal / Large / Larger). Built on `theme.js`.

---

## Ready (first wave — small, grounded)

- **Last-sync visibility** — show last backup/sync date-time; warn in-app if stale; surface
  "cloud sync" as a global action on Home. **(S)** — extends `backup.js` / `BackupReminder.jsx`.
- **Per-field help text** — short hints explaining where each field lands on the PDF. **(S)**
- **Outstanding-balance warning (configurable threshold)** — when an account's total
  outstanding balance exceeds an admin-set threshold (default $1,000), show a warning banner
  both when starting a new WO for that account and on the WO detail screen. **(S)** — reuse
  `accountOutstanding` (per-account balance) and the `accountWarning` banner pattern in
  `unpaid.js`; render alongside the existing 1★ / Do-not-service banner in `WorkOrderNew.jsx`
  and `WorkOrderDetail.jsx`; store the threshold as a Settings value.
- **Account row badges** — show outstanding balance, ⭐ rating, and terms flag on each
  Accounts list row (today rows show only name + phone/address). **(S)** — `Accounts.jsx`
  rows + `accountOutstanding` / `rating` (both already exist).
- **Payment-status pill on Work rows** — colored paid / partial / unpaid pill per row.
  **(S)** — `Work.jsx` `billByWo` + `payments.js`.
- **Tab badge counts** — count of unpaid bills on the Work tab and stuck jobs on Home, shown
  as nav badges. **(S)** — `Layout.jsx` nav; reuse `unpaid.js` and `isStuck` from `stages.js`.
- **Recents on Home** — quick chips linking to recently viewed work orders / accounts.
  **(S)** — `Home.jsx`.
- **Duplicate line item ("add another like this")** — one-tap clone of a bill line. **(S)** —
  `BillEditor.jsx` + existing `SortableList.jsx`.
- **Aging buckets on unpaid (30/60/90)** — color-code overdue balances by age on the Home
  unpaid shortlist and Account detail. **(S–M)** — `unpaid.js`, `Home.jsx`.
- **Overdue-to-start flag (+ expected-start date)** — add an `expectedStartDate` field to the
  WO, then flag jobs whose expected start has passed but aren't started yet (deliberately
  minimal — no Home agenda view). **(S)** — new field in `WorkOrderNew.jsx` / `db.js`; reuse
  the `isStuck` badge pattern from `stages.js`.
- **Revenue by work type** — Reports breakdown of billed/paid by `workTypeId`. **(S)** —
  `Reports.jsx`; WO already records `workTypeId`.
- **Custom share/email message template** — editable default text used when sending a bill via
  the share sheet. **(S)** — `share.js` `text` param + a Settings value.
- **Configurable PDF fields (visibility, global)** — admin on/off toggles in Settings for each
  optional Bill of Sale field (logo, seller phone/email/address, dates, payments summary,
  contact name/phone/email, Unit #, Reference #, issue, signature, terms/notes, photos); core
  fields (account name, line-items table, totals, bill #) stay always-on. **(M)** — store a
  `pdfFields` boolean map on `businessProfile`; guard each section in `pdf.js` and the
  `infoLines` / `paymentLines` helpers in `pdfText.js`; add a toggle panel under Settings →
  Business profile. Reconcile with **Business logo + custom terms on Bill of Sale PDF**
  (logo/terms visibility overlaps).

---

## Needs brainstorm (bigger bets)

- **Work type on each WO row** — show the work type used, per row. **(S — dependency now
  met)** — WO already records `workTypeId`; this is just rendering it in `OrderRow`.
- **Estimate → Bill conversion + win-rate** — a "Convert estimate to bill" action; Reports
  shows estimates sent vs. converted. **(M)** — `isEstimate` already exists in the PDF path.
- **Account/CRM conveniences** — Saved List Views (named status+date+query combos); default
  work type per Account; "Repeat last job" (clone previous WO); first-run onboarding
  checklist; validation-rule toggles (require photo before completing / signature before
  paid); required-contact warning before billing. **(M each)**
- **Inline quick-add account/contact from New WO** — create an account/contact on the fly
  inside the WO form instead of navigating to the Accounts tab and back. **(M)** —
  `WorkOrderNew.jsx` pickers; reuse minimal `AccountForm` / `ContactForm` fields.
- **Global search (cross-entity)** — one search box in the top bar spanning work orders,
  accounts, and contacts from any tab (today search is per-list). **(M)** — reuse
  `SearchBar.jsx` / `filterWorkOrders`; `Layout.jsx` topbar is currently empty except Back.
- **Swipe actions on list rows** — swipe a row for Call / Navigate / Mark paid. **(M)** —
  `Work.jsx` / `Accounts.jsx` rows; reuse `mapsHref` / `smsHref` and `markBillPaid`.
- **Business logo + custom terms on Bill of Sale PDF** — upload a logo and set editable
  footer/terms text that render on the PDF. **(M)** — `pdf.js` layout + `businessProfile`;
  decide logo storage/sizing.
- **PDF layout: relabel + reorder fields** — long-term extension of **Configurable PDF fields
  (visibility)**: also rename field labels (e.g. "Unit #" → "Truck #") and reorder sections.
  **(L)** — depends on the visibility item; `pdf.js` draws in a fixed sequence today, so this
  needs a data-driven render loop over a field registry (`{ key, label, order, visible }`) —
  a meaningful refactor of the render path.
- **Asset / truck tracking (per account) — build FIRST** — new `assets` table keyed to an
  account (make / model / VIN / unit # / plate / mileage / notes + derived service history);
  the WO gains an `assetId` and snapshots the asset's unit # onto its existing `unitNumber`.
  Model after Salesforce Field Service assets. **(M–L)** — new `db.js` table + an account-scoped
  picker (mirrors the contacts pattern); absorbs the parking-lot Truck/Vehicle (Make/Model)
  note. Prerequisite for recurring maintenance jobs. 📄 Spec:
  [specs/2026-06-30-assets-maintenance-plans-design.md](superpowers/specs/2026-06-30-assets-maintenance-plans-design.md).
- **Recurring / maintenance jobs (maintenance plans) — build AFTER asset tracking** — time-only
  cadence per asset; due plans surface on Home ("Maintenance due") for one-tap WO creation
  (suggest-and-confirm, no silent writes); completing the job advances the plan. **(L)** —
  depends on **Asset / truck tracking**. 📄 Spec:
  [specs/2026-06-30-assets-maintenance-plans-design.md](superpowers/specs/2026-06-30-assets-maintenance-plans-design.md).
- **Tighter backup reminder** — configurable interval (today fixed at 14 days in
  `BackupReminder.jsx`); the original ask was every 2/6 hours. **(S)**

---

## Parking lot (raw — triage before building)

- Truck/Vehicle info section on the WO (Make / Model). ⬆️ **Superseded by Asset / truck
  tracking (per account)** in Needs brainstorm — Make/Model become asset fields there.
- Customer reference number field — ⚠️ likely done: `referenceNumber` already exists on the
  WO (separate from the internal bill #). Verify before building.
- Auto-save with undo **or** an unsaved-changes warning when editing a WO (admin toggle to
  turn the warning off). Note: `autosave.js` / `useAutosave.js` already exist — check what
  they cover before building.
- Google Maps API key (available) for richer address autocomplete. Note: there is
  in-progress address-autocomplete work (`addrProvider.js`, `googlePlaces.js`,
  `AddressAutocomplete.jsx`) — reconcile with that first.
